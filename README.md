## Description

I built this project to strengthen my skills with real-world API integration and dynamic web applications. My motivation was to create something practical and user-focused—an app that delivers meaningful information instantly and provides a smooth, responsive experience. 

Through this project, I learned how to work with multiple API endpoints, handle asynchronous requests using fetch() and async/await, manage errors gracefully, manipulate the DOM dynamically, store data persistently with localStorage, and deploy a complete application through GitHub Pages. I also gained experience in structuring JavaScript functions cleanly, designing responsive layouts, and debugging edge cases like missing API data or user typos. I spent a lot more time focusing on proper commenting and labeling of my files with this project. I realized despite spending more time on that, it made the whole project faster and much less of a headache as I could so easily navigate my code and knew where I was at all times.
